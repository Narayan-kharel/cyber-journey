# Week 2 - TryHackMe Notes

In this module, I learned about the different subfields:
- SOC (Security Operations Center)
- Threat Intelligence
- Malware Analysis
- DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response)

I also experienced how to deal with alerts in a simulated SIEM environment. 

While we've covered a lot, the depth and complexity of this field mean there's more to learn and explore. The lessons learned here will serve as a foundation as cyber threats evolve, demanding continuous learning, vigilance, and adaptation.
