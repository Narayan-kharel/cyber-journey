1. Viewing File Permissions
ls -l


ðŸ‘‰ Shows file details, including permissions.

Example output:

-rw-r--r--  1 user user   123 Sep  2  notes.txt
drwxr-xr-x  2 user user  4096 Sep  2  scripts/


Breakdown of -rw-r--r--:

- â†’ regular file (d would mean directory)

rw- â†’ owner can read & write

r-- â†’ group can only read

r-- â†’ others can only read

2. Changing Permissions with chmod

Add execute permission for user:

chmod u+x script.sh


Remove read permission for group:

chmod g-r file.txt


Set read, write, execute for everyone:

chmod 777 file.txt

3. Numeric Permissions

Each permission has a value:

r = 4

w = 2

x = 1

So:

chmod 644 file.txt â†’ owner=read/write, group=read, others=read

chmod 755 script.sh â†’ owner=all, group=read+execute, others=read+execute

4. Changing Ownership

Change owner:

sudo chown newuser file.txt


Change group:

sudo chgrp devs file.txt


Change both owner & group:

sudo chown newuser:newgroup file.txt

5. Special Permissions (advanced but important)

Setuid (4xxx) â†’ runs file as owner.

Setgid (2xxx) â†’ new files inherit group.

Sticky bit (1xxx) â†’ only owner can delete files inside a folder.

Example:

chmod 4755 program
